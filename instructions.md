# Instructions for Bisq

Welcome to Bisq, a decentralized exchange that allows you to trade cryptocurrencies in a true sovereign way. Here's how to get started:

Configure Bisq by clicking on the **"Config"** button and saving default values or making any necessary changes to the **Bisq Title**, **Automatic Login**, and **Password** settings. Then click on the **"Save"** button.

**Note:** The default username is **abc** and the default password is **cba**.

Once Bisq is configured, you are ready to start the service.

## Running Bisq from a web browser:

Running Bisq from a web browser is the preferred method as it can be used on LAN and Tor on any Tor-enabled browser.

1. Launch the Bisq App by clicking on the **"LAUNCH UI"** button. This will open Bisq in your default web browser.
2. Depending on your configuration, you may be logged in automatically or prompted for the username and password.

**Note:** There is a black dot on the middle left part of the screen that is there for your convenience and has a Copy & Paste field, On Screen Keyboard, File Manager, and Fullscreen buttons.

## Running Bisq using an RDP client:

Please note that at this time, using an RDP client can only be used for Tor connections.

1. Ensure that your RDP client can handle SOCKS5 proxy settings. We recommend [Parallels RAS](https://www.parallels.com/products/ras/download/client/) as a client for accessing the Bisq app through Tor.
2. Connect to the .onion address provided by the Bisq > Interfaces through Parallels RAS.
3. Log in with the username and password you set up during the configuration process.

## Using Bisq

The first time Bisq is being used, you will be prompted to read and agree to the user agreement. It may take a few moments to open as it connects to the Tor network and syncs with Bisq's peer-to-peer trading network. Please be patient while the synchronization process completes.
 
Once Bisq is fully synced, you are all set to start trading! If you have any questions or need help, you can refer to the Bisq documentation at https://bisq.wiki/.

Happy and safe trading!
